Link to GitHub repository: https://github.com/Stephanie-Delicia/cs4520-assignment1

### To use:

I was able to run the app on my end and included a video (assignment4_video.mov) of how the app functions. 
So, I believe downloading the code and running it should work with Android 14.

### Added files

#### 1. APIProduct & APIService

These files contain the logic for how API information is fetched.

#### 2. ProductDAO, ProductDB

ProductDB is the database containing product information whereas
ProductDAO describes what methods can be applied to the database,
for retrieving info, deleting data, etc.
